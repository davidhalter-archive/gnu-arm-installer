=== GNU ARM TOOLCHAIN INSTALLER ===

This latest version works with: 

 * binutils-2.19.1
 * gcc-4.3.2.tar
 * newlib-1.16.0
 * insight-6.8

This version of the installer was tested with Ubuntu. Debian should work also. But there is at one point in the download.sh script an aptitude command. You can just ignore this with other systems, but nevertheless, you need to install this library.

To install

1. Download the latest installer gnu-arm-installer-v0.1.tar.gz and then extract by typing:
git clone git://github.com/davidhalter/gnu-arm-installer.git
cd gnu-arm-installer

2. Download the following source files to gnu-arm-installer/src
./download.sh
./gnu-arm-installer.sh

The installer will extract and compile all of the source files automatically. If it is successful, you will get the toolchain in install/ directory.
